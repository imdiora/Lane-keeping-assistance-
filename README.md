# Lane Keeping Assistant 

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a Lane Keeping Assistant (LKA) system. The LKA system uses computer vision techniques to detect and track road lanes to assist in maintaining the vehicle's position within the lanes. This project showcases the LEFT and RIGHT Lane separately.

# Lane Keeping Assistance

This repository contains the code for a Lane Keeping Assistance system that uses computer vision techniques to detect and track road lanes, assisting in maintaining the vehicle's position within the lanes.

## Get This Project Up and Running

### Setting up a Python Virtual Environment for "Lane Keeping Assistance"

It's recommended to maintain a clean and isolated Python environment for your "Lane Keeping Assistance" project. Follow the steps below:

#### Navigate to the Project Directory
```
cd Lane-keeping-assistance/
 ```

## Create a Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
## Activate the Virtual Environment
### On Windows:

```
cmd
venv\Scripts\activate 
```
### On macOS and Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Project Dependencies from requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Running the Project
This project simplifies the process of lane detection to just two Python scripts:

- left_laneDetection.py
- right_laneDetection.py
And a video file:

- drive.mp4
Ensure that both Python scripts and the video file are in the same directory.

### Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository to your desired path, use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/imdiora/Lane-keeping-assistance-
``` 
### Execution 
After setting up your environment and cloning the repository, make sure that the Python scripts (left_laneDetection.py & right_laneDetection.py) and the video file (test1.mp4) are placed in the same directory. Run the scripts to start the lane detection process on the video file.

## How the Code Works

### 1. Image Processing
The foundation of the LKA system is image processing. Since a video is a collection of sequential images, the system processes each image to detect lane lines.

- **readVideo()**: This function is responsible for loading the video file `test1.mp4` from the same directory.

- **Canny Edge Detection**: This is a multi-step process used to detect the edges within an image, which correspond to lane markings. The process involves:
  - **Grayscale Conversion**: Using `cv2.cvtColor` to convert the image to grayscale reduces complexity and simplifies subsequent operations.
  - **Gaussian Blur**: The `cv2.GaussianBlur` function is applied to smooth the image, which helps to diminish noise and irrelevant details.
  - **Canny Method**: The `cv2.Canny` function detects edges by highlighting regions with a high gradient in brightness.

  These steps are integrated into a single function named `canny` to facilitate their collective use.

### 2. Region of Interest
The system must focus on a specific section of the image where lane lines are expected to be. This is referred to as the region of interest (ROI).

- **Region of Interest**:
  To define the ROI, we first establish the area we aim to scan for lane lines. This is often aided by using the Matplotlib library for visualization purposes during development.
  
  After determining the dimensions, we implement a function named `region_of_interest`:

    ```python
    def region_of_interest(image):
        height = image.shape[0]
        polygons = np.array([
        [(200, height), (1200, height), (800, 400)]
        ])
        mask = np.zeros_like(image)
        cv2.fillPoly(mask, polygons, 255)
        masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(image, mask)
        return masked_image
    ```

### 3. Hough Transform
The Hough Transform is employed to discern prominent lines and to connect the dots of edge points in the image, which allows us to infer the presence of lane lines.

    ```python
    lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(cropped_image, 2, np.pi/180, 100, np.array([]), minLineLength=40, maxLineGap=5)
    ```

### 4. Coordinates and Display Lines
The final step in the image processing stage is to calculate the coordinates of the detected lines and display them on the image. This is accomplished with a function called `display_lines`:

    ```python
    def display_lines(image, lines):
        # Logic for drawing lines on the image will be implemented here.
        pass
    ```

### Video Processing
The image processing routines are then applied frame-by-frame to the video stream, resulting in real-time lane detection. This is crucial for an LKA system, which relies on continuous feedback to maintain the vehicle within the lane boundaries.
